# recipes

The model stores a book of recipes.
The service accepts a list of products in a user store as input. Returns the list of dishes with the possible number of servings of each dish, which can be prepared from the available ingredients, as if only this particular dish were prepared.
For simplicity, there are no units for the quantities of ingredients (for example, 1 kg of flour or 200 g of sugar is simply 1 or 200).
